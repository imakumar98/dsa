## Algorithms

### Sorting

1. Bubble Sort              | Comparison Based Sorts    O(n<sup>2</sup>)
2. Insertion Sort           | Comparison Based Sorts    O(n<sup>2</sup>)
3. Selection Sort           | Comparison Based Sorts    O(n<sup>2</sup>)
4. Heap Sort                | Comparison Based Sorts    O(nlogn)
5. Merge Sort               | Comparison Based Sorts    O(nlogn)
6. Quick Sort               | Comparison Based Sorts    O(nlogn)
7. Tree Sort                | Comparison Based Sorts    O(nlogn)
8. Shell Sort               | Comparison Based Sorts    O(n<sup>3/2</sup>) 
9. Count sort               | Index Based Sorts         O(n)
10. Bucket/Bin Sort         | Index Based Sorts         O(n)
11. Radix Sort              | Index Based Sorts         O(n)


Criteria for Analysis of sorting algorithms
1. Number of comparison
2. Number of swaps
3. Adaptive
4. Stable
5. Extra memory
